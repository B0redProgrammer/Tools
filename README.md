## GENERAL DESCRIPTION

In this repository you'll find a couple small scripts which I use in day to day life. If you have any recommendations, suggestions or can help in any way, it's always welcome!

## Book List
This is probably my simplest program, consisting only of a simple script in which you can add book title and genre, which will save these in a seperate file. You can then list the books you want to read, select one at random or select all books from a certain genre.

**Using the Book List:**<br>
  <p>Once you run the main.py script there will be a > sign appearing, waiting for you to input a command. As of right now, there are 6 commands:<br>
    1. add: once inputted, the program will ask you to give both name and genre of the book you want to add. These will then be saved<br>
    2. remove: once inputted, the program will ask you for a book name, which will then be removed from the list.<br>
    3. random: will return a random book from your reading list.<br>
    4. genre: omce inputted, the program will ask you to specify a genre. It will then return all books saved under this genre.<br>
    5. list: once inputted, the program will return a list of all saved books.<br>
    6. quit: stops the program.<br></p>

## Lookup Tables
A simple script with which you can create lookup tables. These will simply match one value to an explanation of this value.
