⊃| A ⊃B is false when A is true and B is false but true otherwise.
⇔| A⇔B is true only if both A and B are false, or both A and B are true.
¬|The statement  is true if and only if ¬A is false.
\mathbb {D} |Domain
∧|The statement A ∧ B is true if A and B are both true; otherwise, it is false.
∨|The statement A ∨ B is true if A or B (or both) are true; if both are false, the statement is false.
⊻|The statement A ⊻ B is true when either A or B, but not both, are true.
⊤|The statement ⊤ is unconditionally true.
⊥|The statement ⊥ is unconditionally false. (The symbol ⊥ may also refer to perpendicular lines.)
∀|∀ x: P(x) or (x) P(x) means P(x) is true for all x.
∃|∃ x: P(x) means there is at least one x such that P(x) is true.
∃!|∃! x: P(x) means there is exactly one x such that P(x) is true.
≔|x ≔ y or x ≡ y means x is defined to be another name for y (but note that ≡ can also mean other things, such as congruence).
⊢|x ⊢ y means x proves (syntactically entails) y
:⇔|P :⇔ Q means P is defined to be logically equivalent to Q.
⊨|x ⊨ y means x models (semantically entails) y
